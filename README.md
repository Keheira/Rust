This repo holds some demo code for rust. Initially I used the class found [here](https://egghead.io/courses/write-your-first-program-with-the-rust-language). I'll be noting a few things that aren't in code in this file.

Notes:
- 
- Int = u32
- `unwrap()` is for quick development
- `expect("")` is better long term
- try/catch = match/ok/err
